## Output Format
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{{
    "title": "Suggested article title",
    "sections": [
        {{
            "heading": "Section heading",
            "content_type": "overview|code_analysis|setup|features|conclusion",
            "key_points": ["point1", "point2", "point3"],
            "estimated_length": "short|medium|long"
        }}
